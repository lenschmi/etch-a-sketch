**Project Notes:**
- The Etch-A-Sketch fills in a square in the grid on a mouseover event
- A CSS grid layout is used to produce a grid of div elements
- There are three different grid densities available. The JavaScript updates the grid density by adding or deleting div elements until the grid holds the appropriate number of squares. 
- There are three color modes available:
  - Classic: Black
  - Rainbow: Each square gets filled in with a random color generated using Math.random()
  - Custom: The user is able to select a color from an HTML color input
