# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project for the Odin Project's Foundations path.

This was mostly based on the project description found [HERE](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

**Project Notes:**
- The Etch-A-Sketch fills in a square in the grid on a mouseover event
- A CSS grid layout is used to produce a grid of <div> elements
- There are three different grid densities available. The JavaScript updates the grid density by adding or deleting <div> elements until the grid holds the appropriate number of squares. 
- There are three color modes available:
  - Classic: Black
  - Rainbow: Each square gets filled in with a random color generated using Math.random()
  - Custom: The user is able to select a color from an HTML color input
